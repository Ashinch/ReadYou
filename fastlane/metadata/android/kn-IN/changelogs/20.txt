### Notes

1. @Ashinch has appointed both @mbestavros and @JunkFood02 as additional Collaborators on Github:

"When I don't have enough free time, I deeply appreciate everyone coming together to contribute to this project. @mbestavros and @JunkFood02 will be added to the list of collaborators for the project, granting you some permissions to manage the project's release plans."

(Source: https://github.com/Ashinch/ReadYou/issues/495#issuecomment-1880344011)

To be absolutely clear: this does not mean that @Ashinch is stepping down from the project! It just means there are more people available to help create new releases. This will help a ton when @Ashinch is busy, and should reduce the time to ship code once it's been merged on Github.

2. On that note: the 0.9.9 release is managed by @mbestavros! I love @Ashinch's work with ReadYou, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to help out with release management.
