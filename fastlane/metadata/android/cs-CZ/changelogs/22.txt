### Notes

It's been quite a week for Read You! This release fixes up most of the rest of the major bugs from release 0.9.9, plus one that's been around for a long while.

My hope is that this will be a solid longer-term build, and we can take a break from releases for a bit while we wait for new improvements to cook from our wonderful community. As always, if you encounter a bug, please report it on Github!

Since some of you may have missed the big changes in 0.9.9, I'll include them again below.
