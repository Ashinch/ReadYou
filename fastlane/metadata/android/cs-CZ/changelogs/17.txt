## 0.9.6

1. Support Fever API (beta)

2. Improve translation (thanks to all)

3. Fix the bug of being in sync all the time when switching accounts

4. Fix the bug that you can't modify other account settings

Fever is an outdated API, which is not fully compatible with modern readers.
But as the first third-party service API supported by Read You, it's a good opportunity to get started.

There will be a supplemental update in the near future for bug fixes and additional translations
